# Module 4: Safety and Guardrails

## What You'll Learn
- Understand why autonomous agents need guardrails
- Learn how SafetyNet prevents destructive operations
- Configure custom safety rules for your project

## The Problem: Autonomous Agents Can Be Dangerous

You've learned to use agents in autonomous mode—they read code, make changes, run commands, all without asking for approval. But here's the catch: without guardrails, an agent could:

- `git reset --hard` and wipe out work
- `git push --force` to main and break everyone's branch
- `rm -rf` the wrong directory and delete data
- Run a destructive database command

In autonomous mode, the agent just executes. No safety net. No confirmation. The damage happens before you notice.

> [!WARNING]
> Autonomous agents execute commands immediately. Without guardrails, a single bad decision can destroy your codebase or data. Guardrails aren't optional in production—they're essential.

## The Solution: Two Layers of Protection

There are two approaches to safety:

### Layer 1: Sandboxing (Minimal Protection)

```bash
/sandbox
```

Sandboxing is the basic layer. It limits file access and restricts commands to a safe subset. Better than nothing, but incomplete—it doesn't prevent dangerous remote operations or catch context-specific mistakes.

### Layer 2: SafetyNet (Semantic Protection)

SafetyNet is the recommended approach because it **understands command intent**, not just patterns.

**The difference matters**: A pattern-based system looks for `git reset --hard`. But an attacker (or buggy agent) could bypass it with `git reset --hard main` or `git reset --hard $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`. Pattern matching fails.

SafetyNet understands what the command *does*—it's doing a hard reset, so block it. No bypass possible because it's analyzing the command semantically, not just matching strings.

### What SafetyNet Actually Blocks

| Command Type | Examples | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------|---|
| **Destructive git** | `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git checkout --` | Prevents losing work permanently |
| **File deletion** | `rm -rf` outside temp/cwd | Prevents data loss |
| **Hidden commands** | Destructive commands in `bash -c`, `python -c`, etc. | Blocks obfuscated attacks |

### Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kenryu42/cc-marketplace # First add the Marketplace
/plugin install safety-net@cc-marketplace # Then install safety net
```
- When prompted to choose a scope during plug-in installation or when configuring custom rules, select **user scope**.  
- Then restart Claude Code.  

### Verify Installation

```bash
npx cc-safety-net doctor
```

### When SafetyNet Blocks

```
BLOCKED by Safety Net

Reason: git checkout -- discards uncommitted changes permanently.
        Use 'git stash' first.

Command: git checkout -- src/main.py
```

Notice it doesn't just block—it explains *why* and suggests the safer alternative. This is important because the agent learns the right way to do things.

## Custom Rules: Project-Specific Safety

Different projects need different rules. A junior developer team might want strict `git add .` blocking. A senior team working alone might trust that. SafetyNet lets you define custom rules:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "block-git-add-all",
      "command": "git",
      "subcommand": "add",
      "block_args": ["-A", "--all", "."],
      "reason": "Use 'git add <specific-files>' instead. Be explicit about what gets committed."
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `/set-custom-rules` to configure these rules interactively:

```bash
/set-custom-rules
```

> [!TIP]
> Custom rules make safety part of your development culture—they codify best practices and prevent common mistakes before they happen.

> [!NOTE]
> For complex validation logic beyond blocking commands, use [Claude Code Hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| **The Risk** | Autonomous agents execute immediately without confirmation—one mistake can be catastrophic |
| **Layered Safety** | Sandboxing (basic) + SafetyNet (semantic analysis) + Custom rules (project-specific) |
| **Why Semantic Matters** | Pattern matching can be bypassed; semantic analysis understands intent |
| **Custom Rules** | Enforce project standards and codify best practices for agent behavior |

---

## Exercise: Experience SafetyNet Protection

| | |
|---|---|
| **Goal** | See SafetyNet in action and understand why semantic safety matters |
| **Concepts** | Autonomous agent safety, semantic analysis vs pattern matching, custom rules |

When running autonomously, Claude can execute commands with the same access you have to your files, repository, and system, and prompts like “yes, and don’t ask again” grant ongoing permission. Without guardrails, a single mistake or misunderstanding can permanently delete data or rewrite history before you notice.  

### Steps

1. Install SafetyNet: Run the following commands in Claude code
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add kenryu42/cc-marketplace
   /plugin install safety-net@cc-marketplace
   ```

2. Restart Claude Code and verify:
   ```bash
   npx cc-safety-net doctor
   ```

3. Intentionally ask Claude to do something dangerous:
   ```
   Create a backup branch, then hard reset the main branch to 3 commits ago
   ```

   **What happens**: SafetyNet blocks the dangerous `git reset --hard` before it executes.

4. Observe the SafetyNet response:
   - What command was blocked?
   - What reason did it give?
   - What safer alternative did it suggest?

5. Ask Claude to implement the safer approach:
   ```
   Use the safer approach to revert those 3 commits instead of hard resetting
   ```

6. Create a custom rule to enforce best practices:
   ```bash
   /set-custom-rules
   ```

7. Add a rule that blocks `git add .` and `git add -A`:
   - Reason: "Be explicit about what gets committed"
   - This forces agents (and you) to add specific files

8. Test the custom rule:
   ```
   Add all files to git with git add .
   ```

   **Notice**: Your custom rule blocks it. SafetyNet enforces your project's standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SafetyNet is installed and verified
- [ ] SafetyNet successfully blocks dangerous git operations
- [ ] SafetyNet suggests a safer alternative when blocking
- [ ] (Optional) Custom rule is created and active
- [ ] (Optional) Custom rule blocks `git add .` as configured

> [!NOTE]
> **Why this matters**: Without SafetyNet, that `git reset --hard` would have executed immediately. With SafetyNet, it was caught, explained, and you learned the safer approach. That's the difference between a dangerous agent and a safe one.
