## The Problem: Tool Integration Hell

Right now, integrating AI with your tools is a mess.

Want Claude to access your database? Build custom code. Want ChatGPT to access the same database? Build it again. Want Gemini? You guessed it—build it a third time.

```
Without MCP:
3 models × 5 tools = 15 custom integrations
Each model needs its own code to talk to each tool
```

Every time you add a new tool, every model needs new code. Every time you add a new model, every tool needs new code. It scales like a nightmare.

> [!WARNING]
> Without a standard, you're writing custom integration code for every model-tool combination. That's wasted time and unmaintainable.

## The Solution: MCP as a Universal Adapter

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the standard language AI models speak to access tools.**

Think of it like USB—before USB, every device needed custom cables. After USB, one plug works with thousands of devices. MCP does the same thing for AI and tools.

```
With MCP:
3 models + 5 tools = 8 implementations
Build a tool once with MCP, all compatible models can use it
```

Build your database server with MCP once. Claude uses it. ChatGPT uses it. Gemini uses it. No custom integration code for each model.

## How MCP Actually Works

When you connect Claude to an MCP server:

1. **Server announces capabilities**: "I have a tool called `query_database`, a tool called `send_email`, and I can read user documentation"
2. **Agent asks what's available**: Claude checks what the server offers
3. **Agent uses what it needs**: Claude calls the specific tools for your task
4. **Server enforces boundaries**: Only allows what you gave permission for, logs everything

### MCP Components

| Component | What It Is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Tools** | Functions the agent can call (`query_database`, `send_email`, `fetch_docs`) |
| **Resources** | Data the agent can read (documentation, schemas, logs, config) |
| **Prompts** | Pre-built instructions the agent can leverage |

### Who Controls What?

The **server controls access**—not the model. The server decides what's allowed, validates inputs before executing, checks permissions, enforces rate limits, and logs everything. This is critical: your MCP server is the security boundary.

## Context7: MCP in Action

Here's a concrete example: **Context7** is an MCP server that gives agents access to documentation.

**Without MCP**: You'd manually search docs, copy-paste examples, hope they're current.

**With Context7 MCP**: Claude asks for documentation on-demand. The server fetches live docs. Claude implements with accurate, current information. One request, fresh data, no manual searching.

This is what MCP enables: **frictionless access to external capabilities**.

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| **The Problem** | Building custom code for each model-tool combination doesn't scale |
| **The Solution** | MCP is a standard—build once, works with any compatible model |
| **Server Control** | The server enforces permissions, validates inputs, and logs actions |
| **Real Benefit** | Access tools and data on-demand without friction or custom code |

## Exercise: Add Due Dates with Context7 MCP

| | |
|---|---|
| **Goal** | Experience MCP in action—use Context7 to implement a feature without manual docs |
| **Concepts** | MCP integration, on-demand documentation access, library implementation |

### Before You Start: Why MCP Matters
MCP lets AI agents safely use real tools and real data instead of guessing or relying on copy-pasted context. Once a tool exposes an MCP server, any compatible model can use it without custom integrations.  

**Concrete MCP examples**
- **Figma MCP**: Read design files, extract colors/components, and check design–code consistency.
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
```
- **Notion MCP**: Search internal docs, policies, and specs using live workspace knowledge.
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
``` 
- **VibeKanban**: Read and update tickets, reason about task status, and coordinate work directly from the board instead of relying on human summaries.  

In this exercise, Context7 applies the same idea to documentation: the agent pulls authoritative, up-to-date docs on demand instead of you searching manually.

### Steps

1. Get your API key from [context7.com](https://context7.com/dashboard). You will have to login with  your Github account, click on "More.." on the website and "Create a New API Key".  
2. Ensure Context7 MCP is installed
   ```bash
   claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code to load the MCP. (To restart Claude, type `exit` in Claude code and run `claude` again)

4. Ask Claude to use Context7 for date-fns documentation:
   ```
   Using Context7 MCP, fetch the date-fns documentation and show me
   the key functions for formatting and parsing dates.
   ```

   **Notice**: Claude doesn't search manually or guess anything! The MCP server context7 fetches live docs on-demand.

5. Ask Claude to implement due dates:
   ```
   Add due dates to todos using date-fns. Each todo should have an optional
   due date that's formatted nicely in the UI. Add the ability to sort todos
   by due date (upcoming first). Use Context7 if you need specific date-fns
   examples or edge cases.
   ```

6. Test the feature:
   - Add todos with and without due dates
   - Verify dates display nicely (e.g., "Today", "Tomorrow", "Jan 25")
   - Sort by due date and verify order
   - Edge case: Test todos with no due date when sorting

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Context7 MCP successfully fetches date-fns documentation
- [ ] Todos have optional due dates
- [ ] Dates are formatted naturally using date-fns
- [ ] Can sort todos by due date (upcoming first)
- [ ] date-fns is properly integrated with no errors
- [ ] You notice how Context7 MCP eliminated the need to manually search docs

> [!NOTE]
> **Why this matters**: Without MCP, you'd manually search date-fns docs, copy examples, hope they're correct. With Context7 MCP, Claude fetches live docs on-demand. That's MCP solving a real problem.
